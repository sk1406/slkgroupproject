        <h3>Roots of Skin Care</h3>
        <p>For millennia, humans have used the bounty of nature to protect skin from 
         the environment.  The ancient Egyptians used sea salt 
         to heal skin conditions like eczema and psoriasis.They also used milk 
         and honey baths to soften skin. Shea butter used to nourish and protect 
         the skin from the harsh sun's rays. Olive oil hair masks were also used to keep 
         locks lusterous and strong.</p>
        
       <p>The skin is your body&#39;s largest organ and absorbs 60&#37 of 
       	topical products. Today's skin care products contain ingredients like 
       	Phenoxyethanol, Cyclopentasiloxane, and a host of other chemicals whose long 
       	term effects are as yet unknown. Take control of your health and pamper 
       	yourself with nourishing natural ingredients like olive oil and coconut 
       	oil to moisturize and papaya to exfoliate. All natural beauty recipes you 
       	can whip in your kitchen that are good for your body and your 
  		pocketbook!</p>
